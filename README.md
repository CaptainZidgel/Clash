Player stats from scrims only, with head-to-head functionality

Main.py is example functionality. Ask for docs if wanted.

Requires [spot](https://github.com/captainzidgel/spot)

I forget how exactly I made my team .json but I assume you just need to json.dump the output of `scrape_players` from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/CaptainZidgel/fc918c8cdef0462c1bd55ac27c609cec)
